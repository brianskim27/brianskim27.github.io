            <p> I am currently a class of 2025 Binghamton University student majoring in Computer Science.
                With a previous interest in the field of law, I continue to aim to help people in the form of coding!
                Additionally, with experience in the marketing and production world, I aspire to apply my creative skills
                in my programming endeavors. Feel free to take a look at what I have worked on down below.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to coding, I engage in multiple hobbies that fill my daily life. I am an avid sports enjoyer,
                especially soccer; unfortunately I am a Tottenham Hotspur fan - nothing short of near heart attacks and
                emotional rollercoasters... I play a variety of video games ranging from MOBA and FPS, namely League of Legends and Valorant.
                My goal is to reach at least Diamond in every competitive game I play (currently working on Teamfight TacticsðŸ¤ž). I especially
                love to spend time with my friends and family, and have vowed to add a golden retriever to my list of loved ones
                in the near future.
