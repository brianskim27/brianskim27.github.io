      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hey there! I'm Brian, a '25 BSCS student at Binghamton University.</p>
      <p>Growing up, I've always enjoyed getting my hands on technology, and after testing the waters with the field of law, I decided to
        pursue the ever-growing computer science world.</p>
      <p>In my free time, I love to play sports and engage in outdoor activities. I especially enjoy soccer, although most of the time you will see me
        in despair because I am unfortunately a Tottenham Hotspur fan ðŸ¤¡
        I have a dream to learn and do well in as many sports as possible. Currently, I am enduring the difficulties in tennis haha.
      </p>
      <p>I enjoy playing videogames, though mostly with friends. The only single-player games you will catch me playing are FIFA and TFT.
        I play a variety of games, from MOBA to shooters, with the goal of achieving the rank-equivalent of at least Diamond in every competitive game I play.
        Currently, I have reached Master in TFT and Diamond in League of Legends and Valorant.
      </p>
